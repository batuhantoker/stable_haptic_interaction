# Stability of haptic interaction
 MATLAB implementation passivity analysis to investigate stability conditions of existing impedance controllers for haptic devices.
 
 This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions for examining the stability of impedance control systems. 



Impedance control is a natural control strategy used in robotics and other fields to achieve precise and stable interaction with the environment. However, the stability of these systems can be difficult to analyze and ensure.



The scripts in this repository provide tools for analyzing the stability of impedance controllers under all conditions. The analysis is based on frequency domain characteristics of the controller, thus stability (or passivity) is ensured for all frequencies or all kind of environmental interaction. 



The human is considered as a passive element during the analysis as we can easily adopt to different dynamics of interaction.
